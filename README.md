My personal website where I write about topics related to finance and data engineering.

## Development Workflow

This site is developed using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Make sure the [latest version](https://quarto.org/docs/download/) is installed.

To render (build) use the following command in the repo folder.

```bash
quarto render
```

To open the latest rendering open the project in a web browser:

```bash
firefox docs/index.html
```

## Quarto Extensions

When using Quarto extensions they should be checked into the GitHub repo.
Extensions used in the project:
