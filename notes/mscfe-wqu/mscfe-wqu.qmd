I am currently studying for this masters program at World Quant University. If you are curious about what is the syllabus and content of the masters, here is a summary from the student catalog.


### 560 Financial Markets

1. Credit Risk and Financing
2. Return and Volatility
3. Correlation
4. Leverage and Non-Linearity
5. Liquidity and Regulation
6. Model Failure and Crisis
7. GWP completion

In this pilot course for the program, students are introduced to the world of professional
finance: markets, products, participants, and regulation. The activities within financial markets will
be discussed, including trading, financing, brokering, pricing, hedging, optimizing, and managing
risk. Throughout the course, students identify a list of significant factors that affect the financial
industry.  
Understanding the asset classes, activities, and influential aspects of the financial landscape will
provide a solid foundation on which students will build mathematical and computational tools to
develop models for financial engineering. No background in finance is required.
<!-- This course will look at the different risks such as:
* Statistical risk: Volatility and Correlation -->

### 600 Financial Data
This course introduces students to financial data: the source of energy for financial models.
Students will learn how to apply Python to properly select, import, filter, structure, visualize,
summarize, and analyze financial data for interest rates, equities, cryptocurrencies, ETFs,
securitized products, and other asset classes. Students will also learn how to prepare data to be
used in models for financial markets, from which decisions can be made, and how to accomplish
fundamental analysis with accounting data, technical analysis with trading data, statistical analysis
with transformed data, and sentiment analysis with textual data. Software engineering,
visualization techniques, probability and statistics, linear algebra, and presentation skills will be
developed throughout the course. The ultimate goal of this course is to build foundational skills
that enable students to understand the type of data needed depending on their goals, how to
source it, structure it, shape it, build with it, and discover what it tells. At their best, financial
engineers turn data into empirically based, well-calibrated financial models whose output
provides investors and risk managers with sound decisions in the uncertain world of finance.


### 610: Financial Econometrics
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to financial econometrics. Students will learn
how to model probability distributions of returns, including graphical, Bayesian, and non-
parametrical methods. They will also learn how to model univariate time series, focusing on their
moving average, autocorrelations, and volatilities, including GARCH models. Students will build
additional tools to see how two financial series can relate to each other, using correlation, vector
autoregressions, and cointegration. Further, they will build the statistical foundation and Python
coding skills to run econometric models to apply in financial decision making. Finally, they will see
how the ideas of bias, variance, and overfitting apply to machine learning.

### 620: Derivative Pricing
Derivative Pricing is a hands-on course focused on pricing options. Students will build a
conceptual background that deepens their understanding of why classical calculus is not sufficient
for detecting rates of change in stochastic processes. Course content focuses on the concept of
no-arbitrage and perfect replication using the world of stochastic calculus, including the Black-
Scholes Model. Students will be able to construct pricing models such as binomial trees and finite
difference methods to price an array of vanilla and exotic options. They will also measure
sensitivities of the price to variables, such as the underlying price, volatility, time, interest rates,
and carry costs. Finally, some extensions to classical models, such as the Heston Model and jump
models will be addressed. Much of the course will include Python illustrations to build practical
skills.

### 622: Stochastic Modeling
In this course, students increase their knowledge of modeling stochastic processes. Students will
investigate advanced volatility models that upgrade Black Scholes parameters to variables,
increasing their stochastic modeling skills to address heteroskedasticity and variable costs as well
as jump diffusions. Students will dive into Markov processes, including hidden Markov process
and Markov decision process to financial applications, and will build a mathematical foundation
for deep learnings, a tool they will use for machine learnings. Overall, students will be able to
evaluate the assumptions, benefits, and difficulties associated with stochastic models.

### 630: Computational Finance
Computational Finance is an advanced computing course that builds skills in optimization,
calibration, and simulation. Student will use data to calibrate models using a variety of numerical
methods, including parametric and non-parametric methods of statistical inference, linear and
non-linear methods, and deterministic and stochastic programming methods. Where problems of
skewness and heteroskedasticity occur, students will use techniques to handle non-normality.
Students will learn how to run simulations, from classical Monte Carlo methods to Markov Chain
Monte Carlo simulation, to agent-based simulations. Student will be able to calibrate the models
they learned in the Derivative Pricing course through numerical, computational, and machine
learning techniques. Python will be used to illustrate these models, from which students will adapt
and apply to fit their own data sets. Once students have calibrated models or optimized portfolios,
they will interpret the coefficients and apply the results to financial decision making.


### 642: Machine Learning in Finance
This course addresses the fundamentals of machine learning. It continues the topics from the
Financial Econometrics course whereby students will be able to apply algorithms to learn from
data. Students will cover the mathematical and computational foundations of both the supervised
and unsupervised machine learning problems, and they will use Python modules and a Tensorflow
framework to predict, explain, or compare outcomes across different financial series. Students will
apply machine learning techniques to determine if financial models are overfit, and use methods
of regularization, cross-validation, and resampling techniques to mitigate it. In addition, students
will develop a theoretical and practical background in deep learning models to improve the power
of their financial model predictions.

### 652: Portfolio Management
This course provides students with methodologies and skills to perform portfolio optimization.
From the previous coursework, students will have a solid foundation on which to engage in the
portfolio management process. In the first two modules, students will review classical methods of
portfolio theory, including Markowitz portfolio optimization. Subsequent modules address more
modern versions of the portfolio optimization process, including Black-Litterman, probabilistic
scenario optimization, prospect theory, Kelly criterion, and risk parity. In addition, advanced
econometrics and machine learning methods will be applied to the classical techniques, including
the use of neural networks, genetic algorithms, information theory, and reinforcement learning.
The course requires students to engage with the mathematical foundations, code implementation,
and practical applications of portfolio management across many asset classes.

### 660: Risk Management
This course provides students with both classical and modern methods of modeling and
managing risk. The course begins by reviewing metrics and models for market, credit, and
systemic risk, and applying these ideas to multiple asset classes, including derivatives. Machine
learning methods will be integrated with both classical methods like VaR and GARCH and with
robust methods like Extreme Value Theory. Then a comprehensive review of Bayesian methods
will be given that builds towards a Bayesian network of modeling systemic risk. By taking the
course, students will be able to synthesize a complex network and scenario analysis for both
portfolio risk and systemic risk.


### 690: Capstone Course
The Capstone Course is designed to put the studentsâ€™ knowledge of financial engineering to the
test. Students practically apply their understanding of the program content by accomplishing
project milestones from developing a problem statement, identifying the required technology to
find a solution to the problem, submitting multiple drafts for peer review and instructor feedback,
and finalizing and presenting their fully developed project. The goal of the Capstone Course is to
ensure that students have met the program outcomes and are able to apply their knowledge and
skills to real-world scenarios.
