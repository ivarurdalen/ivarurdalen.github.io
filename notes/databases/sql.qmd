Here I gather some of the common commands for SQL databases

## MySQL
Create and use new database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE new_db;
USE DATABASE new_db;
```
Create a new user:
```sql
CREATE USER 'new_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
```

Set privileges of the created user
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON new_db.* TO 'new_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## PostgreSQL
Create a new user:
```sql
CREATE USER new_user WITH PASSWORD 'new_password';
```

Set privileges of the created user
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE new_db TO new_user;
```
