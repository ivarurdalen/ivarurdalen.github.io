This note will describe the main categories of trading strategies.\
There are 2 main trading strategies: Trend Following and Mean Reversion.

There are other strategies as well, but they will be elaborated on at a
later stage.

## Trend Following

**Objective:** To enter when a new trend is established, and exit when
the trend is over.

**Indicators:**

-   Moving averages (most common)

-   Trendlines

-   Average Directional Index (measure trend strength)

-   Linear Regression (forecast, slope)

-   Supertrend

**Challenge**: Maintain small losses for losing trades.

**Summary**

Trend following have a few great trades with larger profits, and small
losses on a larger amount of trades. Can go through periods of poor
performance.

## Mean Reversion

**Objective:** Assuming the price will revert back to a mean. Look to
buy oversold, and sell overbought.

**Indicators:**

-   Relative Strength Index
-   Bollinger Bands
-   Disparity Index (distance from moving average)
-   Stochastic oscillator

**Challenge:** Mean reversion is exposed to left tail risk (huge
infrequent losses). Can take a long time to recover from big losses.

**Summary:** Mean reversion typically have small consistent profits, and
low volatility in the strategy.
